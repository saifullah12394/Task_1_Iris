# 💼 Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

## 📌 Objective
To predict medical insurance charges using personal and lifestyle data with Linear Regression.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Medical Cost Personal Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- **Target Variable:** `charges`

## 🧪 Key Steps

1. **Data Inspection**  
   - Loaded and checked data using pandas
   - No missing values found

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Applied One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical columns

3. **Visualization**  
   - Explored relationships between age, BMI, smoker status, and charges
   - Created scatter plots and box plots

4. **Model Training**  
   - Used `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn
   - Trained and tested the model

5. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Smokers pay significantly higher insurance charges
- BMI and age also impact charges
- Linear Regression provides a good baseline model

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## ✅ Output
- `insurance_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and analysis
- `README.md`: This documentation file
